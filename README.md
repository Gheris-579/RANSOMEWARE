<h1>What Does "Military Grade Encryption" Mean?</h1>
<spam>
 Dashlane, a password manager that has advertised its "military-grade encryption," explains what this term means on its blog. According to Dashlane, military-grade encryption means AES-256 encryption. That's the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key size.

As Dashlane's blog points out, AES-256 is "the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect information at a "Top Secret" level."

AES-256 differs from AES-128 and AES-192 by having a larger key size. That means a bit more processing power used for performing the encryption and decryption, but all that extra work should make AES-256 even harder to crack.
